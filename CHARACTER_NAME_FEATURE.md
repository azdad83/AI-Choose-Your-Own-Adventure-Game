# Character Name Feature Implementation

## 🎮 New Feature: Custom Character Names

The game now prompts players to enter their character's name when starting a new adventure, replacing the hardcoded "Elara" with their chosen name throughout the entire story.

## 🔧 How It Works

### For New Adventures:
1. **Character Creation Screen** appears after selecting "Start new adventure"
2. **Name Input** with validation (minimum 2 characters)
3. **Name Storage** in Qdrant vector database as metadata
4. **Dynamic Prompt** uses the character name throughout the story

### For Continuing Adventures:
1. **Name Retrieval** from stored session metadata
2. **Welcome Back** message with character name
3. **Consistent Storytelling** maintains the same character name

## 📱 User Experience

### New Adventure Flow:
```
=======================================================
GAME OPTIONS
=======================================================

2. Start new adventure

CHARACTER CREATION
=======================================================

✓ Welcome, Alex, to your adventure!

✓ Started fresh adventure

Session ID: session_1755...
=======================================================
Welcome, Alex, to the mystical journey in the Whispering Woods!

=======================================================
```

### Continuing Adventure Flow:
```
Choose an option (1 or 2): 1

✓ Continuing adventure: session_1755...

----------------------------------------
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### New Methods Added:

#### `QdrantChatMessageHistory` Class:
- `store_character_name(character_name: str)` - Store name as metadata
- `get_character_name() -> str` - Retrieve stored character name

#### Main Functions:
- `get_character_name() -> str` - User input with validation

### Database Storage:
- **Metadata Points**: Special vector points storing character names
- **Session Association**: Character names linked to specific sessions
- **Fallback Handling**: Defaults to "Elara" if name retrieval fails

### Dynamic Prompt Generation:
```python
template = f"""You are now the guide of a mystical journey in the Whispering Woods. 
A traveler named {character_name} seeks the lost Gem of Serenity. 
You must navigate {character_name} through challenges, choices, and consequences...
```
